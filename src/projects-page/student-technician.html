            Goals & Reflections
            <div class="student-technician-page_subtext">
                <ol>
                    <li>One of my personal goals during my time as an IT Technician was to develop my
                        <strong>Independence, problem solving, and critical thinking</strong> skills. Through the term I
                        made sure that before asking for any help I would try to make sure to attack the problem through
                        two or three angles. This goal was related to my job task as when diagnosing and solving
                        problems I did not always have my supervisor or a manager to help me out. Developing a strong
                        set of problem solving skills allowed me to become independent and efficient in all my tasks.
                        Reflecting on this goal I found that it was very useful in helping me develop independence and
                        critical thinking. Making sure that I try to solve the problem with at least 3 methods allowed
                        me to develop my problem solving skills and gain familiarity regarding my job. Furthermore, I
                        found that it helped me remember the steps to solve the problem much better than when I would
                        ask right away. The measure of success was a bit more convoluted as I believe that the term
                        simpler is up to interpretation. For my measure of success I should have been more specific on
                        what I mean "simpler problem" as a simpler problem for someone else may be much more complicated
                        for the other person. I believe that this was an important goal that I reached during the work
                        term and hope to continue improving on my problem solving and critical thinking skills for the
                        future.
                    </li>
                    <li>My second goal of the term was to improve on my <strong>communication and teamwork
                            skills</strong>. My goal was to make sure that I would check in with my teammates at least
                        three times every day. This goal was important for my job as we often had to travel in teams and
                        plan out our daily schedules to make sure that one person was in office at all times. Making
                        sure that everyone was up to date with everyone's schedules and needs was an important factor in
                        our day-to-day. Upon reflecting on this goal, I found that it was not necessary as time went on.
                        As both my teammates and I had more familiarity with the job it became tedious to check in with
                        each other. In addition, with how we communicated we ended up already checking on each other.
                        There was no need to make a conscious effort to check in three separate times. While the initial
                        goal became tedious after the initial months, I believe that my measure of success was useful.
                        Checking in with my teammates at the end of the week helped me make sure that everything was on
                        track and made sure that everyone was kept in the loop. In the end, I found that I would change
                        the goal so that it was to make sure that I communicate any changes or any events to my
                        teammates as I believe that that would be more useful in the long run.
                    </li>
                    <li>My third goal for the co-op was to learn more about <strong>Windows and Mac software</strong> as
                        well as learn about <strong>computer hardware</strong>. I planned to reach this goal by keeping
                        a notebook handy that I could write down any useful shortcuts, solutions, or new hardware that I
                        didn't know about before. This goal aligns with my job as by gaining familiarity with both
                        software and hardware has allowed me to become much more efficient with my job and my solutions.
                        Furthermore, keeping a notebook handy allows me to quickly reference any knowledge that I may
                        have forgotten. Reflecting on this goal, I found that this goal was quite useful as it allowed
                        me to keep track of all necessary shortcuts that I needed. In addition, having references to all
                        my solutions and shortcuts was an important piece of documentation that I utilized a lot. I
                        found that while in the beginning I was constantly writing in my notebook at a certain point I
                        was not writing in my notebook anymore.
